**Purpose**:

Team 3 was responsible for implementing the structure, styling, and basic functionality of our application as well as unit testing. As a group we added our main html, css, and js files to build the foundation. We added the features to process and style text which includes underline, italic, and bold features. We were also given the task to add codeblocks feature. In order to do that, we examined the pros and cons of having a toolbar with or without any dependency. We chose to add this feature without any dependency adhering to the local first principle. Furthermore, we added the image feature and unit tests to test the overall functionality of our script. Finally, we adopted the changes that were made by Team 1 and Team 2 and fixed things accordingly. Last but not least, in a collaboration with Terence from Team 2, we also added light/dark mode for our webpage.
