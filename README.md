# Sub-Team 2: API and Tagging System

**Members**

**Purpose**
Team 2 was responsible for creating the basic API structure with the CRUD operations for notes.  These CRUD functions were based on saving to local storage for a long time, adhering to the local first principle.  As a group, we were also responsible for creating the tag system which we designed and then tailored to be less complex for both the user and the developer.  We went from considering a color dependency to implementing tag creation with limited colors to adhere to the KISS principle.  We also added functionalities to filter notes by tag and to allow the user to access a dropdown of previously created tags. Team 2 was also in charge of styling our tags and creating unit tests for tag and note creation. Furthermore, in order to package our project as a web app, we had for adopt a new file storage system made by Team 1, which required us to switch from local storage to electron saving techniques for both notes and tags.
