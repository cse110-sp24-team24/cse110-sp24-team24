## problem
1. The tagging system from the first sprint, uses commas to seperate them


## Tagging system

1. create a new function to add tags into a new <ul> tag made in index.html.
2. have the tags be displayed in the editor, by showing it right between the content and the date box
3. Store the saved tags into a JSON file, upon clicking the save button
4. You are able to change the color of the tags(if you wish)
5. Dropdown box that stores all previously added tags from other notes
6. The search bar now only filters by the title name, also created anothe dropdown box that filters by a specific tag
7. Home button now resets the filter tag
