### Retrospective

1. **What went well:**

   - almost everyone accomplished what we had for the sprint
   - project is getting closer to being completed!
   - Teams are being careful about merging good code and have been flexible with the sprint deadlines. We finished what our sprint goal was!
   - Everyone was hard at work finishing their own assigned task in each team

2. **What did not go well:**

   - Had some trouble with previous written code, and had to make some changes
   - Had difficulty with getting to meet up more consistently/regularly to discuss tasks/progress
   - There's not as much communication as there should be
   - all teams need to be in sync with each other.

3. **Improvements to make:**

   - Each sub teams need to be more communicative with each other
   - Add comments to code and decompose the files where necessary
   - Finish up whatever we have right now and merge so we can focus on testing and debugging. Donâ€™t need more features.
   - Need to finalize the fileStorage and testing
   - start merging and fix stuff for the final version

4. **Action Items:**

   - Each team finish up their tasks and start merging to deploy branch
   - Focus on testing, debugging, as well as any styling
