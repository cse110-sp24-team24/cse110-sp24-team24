## Meeting Notes

### Retrospective

1. **What went well:**

   - Our project is functional and looks amazing! We successfully created the completed project in a collaborative environment.
   - Everyone got great practice with Git and version control, including how to make issues, pull requests, and branches. We overcame difficulties with merge conflicts and gained knowledge on code management.
   - Each person contributed their best and got their work done on time, and was willing to meet outside of class. We got good practice on how to work with a team!

2. **What did not go well:**

   - Some of the tasks were blockers for each other, which led to some people having to wait to begin their tasks. Sometimes, people had to wait because they weren't sure if others were done with a prerequisite task.
   - It was a little confusing figuring out how to merge multiple moving components together.
   - Minor issues with Github permissions and committing to branches.

3. **Improvements to make:**

   - Figure out ways to split up tasks more efficiently. Perhaps we can make a workflow graph of all the tasks to choose tasks that do not have blockers to begin with. We can also add deadlines for blocker tasks.
   - Start recording Zoom meetings for absentees!
   - Add more starter code so everyone has the same foundation to work with.
   - Use the Miro board more effectively, so everyone is on the same page about design, responsibilities, etc.

4. **Action Items:**

   - Research testing and CI/CD pipelines for actual project.
   - Apply what we learned from warmup towards set up for final project.

### Group Activity

For the group activity, we created a number line from 1 to 10, and had each person place an emoji of their choice on the number line to represent their satisfaction with the group and warmup project. Overall, everyone seemed to be happy with the work so far!
