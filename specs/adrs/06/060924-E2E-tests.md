# ADR: Issue with End-to-End Tests in basicFeature.test.js and electron.test.js

## Context:
We encountered significant challenges in getting the end-to-end (E2E) tests to work on time in the files basicFeature.test.js and electron.test.js. Our project uses Electron for building desktop applications and JSDOM for simulating a browser environment in our tests.

## Decision:
Despite our best efforts, we could not get the E2E tests functioning properly due to the following reasons:

### Electron Integration: 
Electron combines Chromium and Node.js, creating a unique environment that is not fully compatible with JSDOM. This incompatibility caused several issues, particularly when trying to simulate user interactions and application behavior in a way that accurately reflects the Electron environment.

### JSDOM Limitations: 
JSDOM, while a powerful tool for simulating browser environments in Node.js, does not perfectly emulate all aspects of a real browser. This limitation affected our ability to replicate certain features and behaviors of Electron applications, leading to unreliable test results.

## Alternatives Considered:
Switching to a Different Testing Framework: We considered using other testing frameworks like Puppeteer or Playwright, which are designed to handle real browser environments and might better support Electron applications. However, integrating these frameworks within our existing test suite would have required significant refactoring and time investment, which was not feasible within our project timeline.

### Mocking Electron-Specific APIs: Another alternative was to mock the Electron-specific APIs and functionality within our tests. While this approach might have worked for some tests, it would not provide the same level of confidence as real E2E tests running in an actual Electron environment.

## Consequences:
Due to the constraints mentioned above, we had to prioritize our resources and focus on other critical areas of the project. As a result, the E2E tests in basicFeature.test.js and electron.test.js remain incomplete.

## Next Steps:
Evaluate Puppeteer/Playwright: Post-release, we plan to evaluate Puppeteer or Playwright to potentially replace JSDOM for our E2E tests. This evaluation will include setting up a prototype to ensure compatibility with Electron and assessing the effort required for full integration.

Documentation and Training: We will document the current limitations and the workarounds we explored. Additionally, we will provide training to our team on using the new tools and frameworks to ensure a smooth transition.

Incremental Refactoring: Once a new testing framework is selected, we will incrementally refactor our existing tests to ensure they are compatible with the new setup, starting with the most critical tests to ensure minimum disruption.

By addressing these issues in a phased manner, we aim to establish a robust and reliable E2E testing framework that accurately reflects the behavior of our Electron application.
