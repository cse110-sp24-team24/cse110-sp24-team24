# ADR - Issue with End-to-End Tests in basicFeature.test.js and electron.test.js

## Context and Problem Statement:

We encountered significant challenges in getting the end-to-end (E2E) tests to work on time in the files basicFeature.test.js and electron.test.js. Our project uses Electron for building desktop applications and JSDOM for simulating a browser environment in our tests.

## Considered Options:

Switching to a Different Testing Framework: We considered using other testing frameworks like Puppeteer or Playwright, which are designed to handle real browser environments and might better support Electron applications. However, integrating these frameworks within our existing test suite would have required significant refactoring and time investment, which was not feasible within our project timeline.

## Reasoning:

Despite our best efforts, we could not get the E2E tests functioning properly due to the following reasons:

### Electron Integration: 
Electron combines Chromium and Node.js, creating a unique environment that is not fully compatible with JSDOM. This incompatibility caused several issues, particularly when trying to simulate user interactions and application behavior in a way that accurately reflects the Electron environment.

### JSDOM Limitations: 
JSDOM, while a powerful tool for simulating browser environments in Node.js, does not perfectly emulate all aspects of a real browser. This limitation affected our ability to replicate certain features and behaviors of Electron applications, leading to unreliable test results.

### Mocking Electron-Specific APIs: 
Another alternative was to mock the Electron-specific APIs and functionality within our tests. While this approach might have worked for some tests, it would not provide the same level of confidence as real E2E tests running in an actual Electron environment.

## Decision Outcome:
Due to the constraints mentioned above, we had to prioritize our resources and focus on other critical areas of the project. As a result, the E2E tests in basicFeature.test.js and electron.test.js remain incomplete.
