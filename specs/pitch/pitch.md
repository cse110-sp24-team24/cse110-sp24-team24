## Problems

- Developers face challenges in documenting their progress with everyday and long term tasks, as there is no good centralized way to record both code snippets and regular documentation. Existing solutions don't cater towards the specifc functionality that developers are looking for in their note-taking or journaling applications.
- Oftentimes, developers face bugs/issues that show up repeatedly and are not simple to fix. Even after finding a solution, there is not a good way for them to record how they solved the problem, leading to much unnecessary stress of trying to resolve it when they face the issue again. Similarly, it is currently difficult to access old code that may be useful or reusable.
- Furthermore, it is hard to keep track of work-related resources (i.e. Github links, StackOverflow, etc), since there are so many links and resources and no way to organize everything.
- These pain points are ubiquitous across the developer community. We want to propose a solution that addresses these problems and makes work life simpler for developers, to drive productivity and project success.

## Appetite

- Considering that our timeline is only 4ish weeks, we should be cautious about the features we commit to
- The work should be communicated and split up in a clear way. We should understand which features depend on each other so that we don't get stuck with a dependency
- We should prioritize the most important features first, and then reevaluate our other ideas
- We should aim to complete the prototype within _2 weeks_ to allow enough time for testing, style, etc
- We should always allow a "buffer time" for unforseen issues. The final week should be focused on wrapping up the work (rather than rushing other features)
- We should try to meet up at least once per week in person, small groups or all together. This would help resolve isues of communication and staying on track. We might have issues with coordinating everyone's schedules, so small groups might be ideal.

## Brainstorming

Our team largely brainstormed using [this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKNcw5I4=/).

### User stories

We started off the brainstorming process by creating a lot of user stories (around 4 per team member), shown in the image below. Each user story was categorized according to a specific feature that we could implement in our developer journal web app. Finally, we voted on our favorite features that we thought would be the most high priority to include in our CRUD app. Creating user stories really helped us identify the main pain points that users currently face so that we could prioritize creating an app that could provide a strong user experience. The chosen features based on our voting will be used as issues during the actual project, which will help with organization and establishing a development timeline.

### UI Development

We divided into smaller groups to brainstorm ideas for the UI that we wanted to create. While going through this process, we surveyed other ‘competitors’ apps that had aspect that we liked and wanted to include. The small group sessions resulted in many different ideas for how we wanted our UI to look, and each group had good solutions included in their UI to solve the main problems we outlined above. For example, we all voted to have a separate page pop up for each journal entry upon it being clicked. In the end, we took a vote to decide on the UI we liked the most and the small features from each one that we wanted in the final product, and used these to build up a final user interface that we drew together as a team (an image of which is shown in the Solution section below).

## Solution


### Current UI Design
![design](solution.png)

Need to narrow down the core features for note-taking.
Suggestions (in order from critical to lesser):

1. contain multiple notes displayed in chronological order
2. Search Filtering (organization)
   - create a search filter that will only display notes that are filtered by tags and title
   - also filters by all text context in the note
3. titles and dates for notes
   - Title and date set as attribute in note object (date default set as day note was added)
4. tagging
    - Allow user to create tags for notes to make searching for specific notes possible
5. edit/save/delete note (with warning)
    - Button for edit, save, and delete should be connected to the actual note
6. hovering tool bar functions for editing notes (italicize, bold, images, etc)
   - Tool bar pops up when editing different notes
   - insert/ delete code blocks, images, videos, external links are also options in this tool bar 
7. Has a side bar with a home button and an add button for a new task (in order to navigate between new notes and current available notes)

## Technology

1. Html, CSS, Javascript for creating the website
2. Git 4 version control
3. Github for collaberation
4. Miro team brainstorming
5. Slack communitcating
6. Zoom for meetings

## Unit Testing:
- Use jest & pupeteer 
- Unit testing parallelly with development
  
## Database:
- Using electron and the users local file system

## Timeline:
**Week 7**
- (Only 1 note) MVP finished
    - Electron + File Storage(3ppl) (Figure out electron)
    - API /Structure(4ppl) (make a basic api to process note data and decide on the structure of that note data)
    - Editing/Text(4 people)
        - UI/html structure
        - Process the text

**Week 8** (multi note is done by May 25th)
- Implementing the home
- Multiple notes

**Week 9** (Fix any egregious bugs) ← A DONE PROJECT
- Bug fixs

**Week 10**
- Additional features (TBD)

**Week 11**
- Final wrapup (TBD)
  

## Non-functional features:
  - Performance:
    - Faster than 3 seconds (the average load time on desktop on google)
  - Accessibility:
    - Accessible color palette (color blind friendly)
    - Screen reader compatibility
    - Using electron.js so only local to computer   


## Rabbit Holes/Risk Analysis

Avoid complexity and to achieve minimalism, we all need to work with a basic skeleton of the notes. Perhaps we can transfer the add/delete function from our warm-up exercise and make it our skeleton. Last time, our tasks were too dependent on each other and we had long waiting times.
Here's a potential skeleton:

- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvtxYX4sw08 - html - part1)
- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM4edrhLEjM - part2)
- (https://youtu.be/HdHk1SaL5M0?feature=shared&t=199 - part3 - has nice outline of js functions)

### What Else We Learned from Last Time

- Focusing on the small details that may not cause too big of a difference instead of looking at the overall project
- Focusing too much time on adding new features instead of making sure the basic ones are well implemented
- Exploring new tech in limited timeframe
- Not communicating well with other teams on what they’re doing, how they’re implementing, the progress they’ve made, any issues
- Don’t get overeager with how much we accomplish and try to do more than we can handle in the given time frame
- Not documenting enough on our progress
- Waiting for whole group meetings to discuss next steps
  - Can discuss in slack/in smaller groups

## No Gos

- no auto save
- no keyboard shortcuts
- no implementation of an IDE
- no music
- no email/ Google calendar sync
- no timer/alarms
- not tracking progress of tasks
- no sharing function for notes
