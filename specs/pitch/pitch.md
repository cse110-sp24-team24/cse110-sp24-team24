## Problems
- Might get lost in complexity because there are many features, so we should firstly build the note-taking feature.
- Hard to ensure the journal aligns with different needs and preferences.

## Appetite
3 weeks to build working prototype; 2 weeks to finetune, style, and user tests. 3 weeks would constrain us to build a basic skeleton of our main feature, the notes. 

## Solution
Need to narrow down the core features for note-taking. 
Suggestions (in order from critical to lesser):
1. add multiple notes
2. title
3. tagging
4. save/ delete note (with warning)
5. tool bar functions (italicize, bold, images, etc)
6. insert/ delete code blocks, images, videos
   
## Rabbit Holes
Avoid complexity and to achieve minimalism, we all need to work with a basic skeleton of the notes. Perhaps we can transfer the add/delete function from our warm-up exercise and make it our skeleton. Last time, our tasks were too dependent on each other and we had long waiting times. 
Here's a potential skeleton: 
- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvtxYX4sw08 - html - part1)
- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM4edrhLEjM - part2)
- (https://youtu.be/HdHk1SaL5M0?feature=shared&t=199 - part3 - has nice outline of js functions)

## No Gos
- no auto save
- no keyboard shortcuts
- no implementation of an IDE
- no music
- no email/ Google calendar sync
- no timer/alarms
- not tracking progress of tasks
- no sharing function for notes
